# deep_learning_project

1). Autonomous driving â€“ Car detection (YOLO algorithm)

Implement the basic filtering and no-max suppression part for YOLO algorithm and achieve a car detection system with more than 80 different classes

2). NLP Projects (LSTM, Attention Model)

Build a neural machine translation model to translate human readable dates into machine readable dates with an attention model
